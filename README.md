# Analog Cuckoo Clock

An analog clock with a 30-second timer that shows current time with lighting.

## Summary

An analog clock that shows current time in military time format with textï¼Œ and current seconds on the clock by the glowing dots.

A cuckoo bird pops out and chirps every 30 seconds.

## Component Parts

Describe the components, or pieces, that make up your project.

Include what types of inputs/outputs/data it will use. You can also upload an image with a diagram showing how all those pieces are connected.

## When your project is completed, you will then add the following sections:

## Timeline

What did you do in each of the past four weeks?

- Week 0: Write Proposal
- Week 1: Decide to do an anolog clock on P5 instead of an Arduino clock
- Week 2: Find examples and references, get the clock working
- Week 3: Add animation and sound
- Week 4: Present!

## Challenges

Getting the dots go around the clock was hard. I had to draw 60 lines evenly arranged around the center and another circle that covers the center part. Another challenge is to place that cuckoo image and scale it. I tries several times before it worked, but the result is satisfying.
